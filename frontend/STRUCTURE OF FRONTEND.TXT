make a file workoutdetails in component folder nd import in home.js 

10.
make a workoutForm inside components to create a form for user to give input.
Inside workout form we also convert object to json file and check for error.

11.
now on adding new data it doesnot get rerender byself , we have to do it correctly so 
as adding new data gets re render automatically.
So we use "Use context"

new folder context
new file WorkoutContext.js
then make a useReducder to set state and dispatch objects
then make a folder hooks
inside make useWorkoutsContext to call the WorkoutContext
import WorkoutContext in Home and make object "workouts ,payload" to use dispatch objects in SET_WORKOUTS.

solve the prob of refreshing to get newly added data..........!!
import hook ->useWorkoutsContext in workoutForm
